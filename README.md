## What does the plugin do? 

The plugin adds a heart-like icon to posts. Users can clicked on the heart icon to 'like' the post. This updates the number of likes a post has. 


**New feature:**

If user is logged out then likes are based on cookies. If the user is logged in, the likes are based on user meta. This means a logged in user can come back to the site in the future and see which posts they have liked. 

Users can view their liked posts by viewing posts and seeing an active heart icon. Currently there isn't to view all liked posts in one place.
