## What does the plugin do? 

The plugin adds a heart-like icon to posts. Users can clicked on the heart icon to 'like' the post. This updates the number of likes the post has. 

Currently the plugin works based on cookies. A user doesn't have to login to like a post. 

Future versions may have option to toggle whether use has to be logged in or not.
